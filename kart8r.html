        If you love Mario Kart 8 as much as we do, this application is for you. This is a utility add-on for the very popular Mario Kart 8. You and up to three friends can use the app to randomly select your character, vehicle, tire, and wing combination before a tournament. Or you can use it solo to help that perfect combination that's been preventing you from beating the time trial ghosts.
        </p><p>
            The app came about because my family plays Mario Kart 8 for hours at a time. However, after a while, we discovered that each of us tended to favor the same character and kart combination.
        </p><p>
            We made a house rule that no one could use their favorite combinations anymore, so we started throwing dice for each player, vehicle, tire, and wing. It took awhile to do this for each player. And quite frankly, it's hard to find 18-sided dice. We had to come up with something a little simpler. One day my son suggested that it would make a great mobile app.
        </p><p>
            So I sat down and created one.
        </p><p>
            It isn't just a randomizer. Using the settings screen, you can chose to include or exclude characters based on size, or complete classes of vehicles. You can also tell the app not to allow item duplication for any players, ensuring the maximum flexibility. 
        </p><p>
            Using the app is simple. Just tap the shuffle icon in the top right corner of the screen. If you really dislike any particular player, you can tap that player's button to re-roll just that player. Note that if you do that, the duplication prevention won't apply.
        </p><p>
            I have taken great care not to use any proprietary assets. Everything, to my knowledge is fan created.
        </p><p>
        I hope you enjoy this labor of love. Suggestions welcome.
