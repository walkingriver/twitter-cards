    <h1>Park Pursuit - A Mobile Scavenger Hunt</h1>
    <p>
        Park Pursuit began life as a team-building exercise that a former boss ran for us at Epcot a number of years ago. The clues
        were printed on multiple sheets of paper, duplicated, and distributed to teams. Each team had four hours to find
        as many clues as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few years later, I ran a similar scavenger hunt for my boy scout troop. We did one in the Magic Kingdom, and another in
        Disney's Animal Kingdom Park. One day, it occurred to me that a mobile version would not only be fun, but easier
        to distribute, and a lot less costly in terms of paper and ink. Park Pursuit was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game is designed to allow scavenger hunts to be created anywhere in the world. However, living in Central Florida, the
        Disney Theme Parks seemed to be the natural place to start. As a bonus, we recently added 20 clues to seek from the
        Brigham Young University Campus in Provo, Utah.
